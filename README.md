# Weight Converter

### Vanilla Javascript Project

#### Project description

##### Let's embark on creating a weight converter project focused on converting pounds to kilograms. The webpage will present an intuitive interface comprising an input field where users can enter a weight in pounds. Automatically, the webpage will display the corresponding weight in kilograms. To ensure a seamless user experience, the result will vanish after 10 seconds, and the input field will be reset using the 'setTimeout' method. Additionally, we have implemented an error handling mechanism to gracefully manage negative input numbers. In the event that a negative number is entered, the webpage will promptly exhibit an error message, "Please enter a valid number." To tackle this, we will leverage an event listener assigned to the input field, invoking a function that adeptly handles error situations, including the removal of the error message after a brief two-second interval. Through this project, we will master the art of error handling and event-driven programming.
